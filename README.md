#  **Shell software:**

This is a straightforward shell application with command execution capabilities and some built-in commands. This C-coded software has undergone testing on a Linux operating system.

# **Getting Started:**

Clone this repository and use a C compiler to compile the program in order to execute it. Here are the instructions to compile:

gcc –o shell –shell.c –lreadline

Then, carry out the following instruction to start the program:

./shell

After the program has started, you can begin issuing instructions.

# **Usage:**

Along with the built-in commands below, this shell program can perform commands.

Change location with cd

Exit: close the terminal application

help: show assistance data

copying a file (cp) 

History: show the command history 

Fortune: show a free random quotation 

Make a fork weapon with "forkbomb": crashing PC using fork()

Use Shell Part to get the following help command:

offers a list of all possible commands under "help"

help [command] - explains how to use the specified command

Simply type the instruction into the shell prompt and hit enter to run it.

# **Challenges:**

Implementing pipes and knowing how to write a shell in C.   
Implementing the free command required using particular, unknown C functions.   
Complexity issues occasionally arise with our built-in commands.
